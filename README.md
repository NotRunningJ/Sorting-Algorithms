# Sorting-Algorithms
My implementation of a faster mergeSort and quickSort algorithm than those in the book we were reading for my **Algorithms & Data Structures** class.
There is also an anaylsis of the runtime for the different sorting algorithms, as well as a notice that the default sorting algorithm for arrays
is faster than them all becuase it uses a version of quicksort with more than one pivot.
